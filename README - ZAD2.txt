For analyitics:
AnalyticsCollisionTracker - sends out an event when a player colided with something, once it collides with something it has 5 seconds until it will send out event again
AnalyticsMovementTracker - tracks movement for 10 units it will only repeat 5 times in a single build
AnayliticStartUp - tracks every time the game started

Notice: This is my first time using analytics and since it takes time for the data to be uploded on Unity Dash board I don't know if it is working entirely as planned but hopefully the code proves it does
